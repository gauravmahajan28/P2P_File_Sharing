make -> creates two executables server client

start server
 ./server 127.0.0.1 8081 mapping.txt temp.txt /home/gaurav/Desktop/IIIT_Material/sem1/OS/Assign_2/

server creates one UDP thread to listen to heart beats on SAME port

2) one to handle file upload service / RPC service
3) one to send heart beats to CRS
